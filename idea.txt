Pokemon-like structure
- Limited number of tiles on a map
- Seamless transition between maps (towns/"routes")


Okay, straight out Pokemon G1 clone.

- Towns are "maps" connected together (so are routes)
- Sprites are entities moving in the world
- Maps are tile-based - relatively limited number of positions

*For now, concentrate on getting overworld functionality, no battles, etc.*
- Dialogue (Timed appearance of letters, mimic scrolling)
