Pokemon-like structure
- Seamless transition between maps (towns/"routes")
- Towns are "maps" connected together (so are routes)
- Sprites are entities moving in the world

*For now, concentrate on getting overworld functionality, no battles, etc.*
- Dialogue (Timed appearance of letters, mimic scrolling)

Resources
- Maps
- Sprite sheets
  - Characters (walking, standing, etc.)
  - Pokemon
  - Items
  - Tiles (Maps not images but matrix of IDs)
  - Recurring textures (Pokemart, Pokecenter, houses?)

How do we want to go about this?
    - Player movement
        - Smooth movement
            - 1 step = 12 frames = 0.2 sec
            - Stepping
                - Move 2 in new direction
                - Turn, move 14
                - Repeat

Maps and the World
    - The "world" surface will contain all the maps for the world, each loaded on demand
    - Loaded maps will be subsurfaces
    - Track player's position on the world as a set of coords
    - And keep a list of boundaries for each map
    - As player's position approaches the boundary, load the adjacent map
    - When crossing over into a new map, change music
