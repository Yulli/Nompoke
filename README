Pokemon-like structure
- Limited number of tiles on a map
- Seamless transition between maps (towns/"routes")


Okay, straight out Pokemon G1 clone.

- Towns are "maps" connected together (so are routes)
- Sprites are entities moving in the world
- Maps are tile-based - relatively limited number of positions

*For now, concentrate on getting overworld functionality, no battles, etc.*
- Dialogue (Timed appearance of letters, mimic scrolling)

Resources
- Maps
- Sprite sheets
  - Characters (walking, standing, etc.)
  - Pokemon
  - Items
  - Tiles (Maps not images but matrix of IDs)
  - Recurring textures (Pokemart, Pokecenter, houses?)

How do we want to go about this?
- Start with coding rather than creating content
    - Map structures
        - Consider: can a Rect be larger than a given Surface?
    - Player movement
        - The sprite extends up to 4 pixels ABOVE the tile it is standing on
Do that first :3


More specific todo for today
- Download "first map" - Pallet Town?
- Analyse and record textures (get a start on the texture sheet)
- Create map storing structure (worry about compression later)

When considering display/graphics, keep different size options in mind.
