Pokemon-like structure
- Limited number of tiles on a map
- Seamless transition between maps (towns/"routes")


Okay, straight out Pokemon G1 clone.

- Towns are "maps" connected together (so are routes)
- Sprites are entities moving in the world
- Maps are tile-based - relatively limited number of positions

*For now, concentrate on getting overworld functionality, no battles, etc.*
- Dialogue (Timed appearance of letters, mimic scrolling)

Resources
- Maps
- Sprite sheets
  - Characters (walking, standing, etc.)
  - Pokemon
  - Items
  - Tiles (Maps not images but matrix of IDs)
  - Recurring textures (Pokemart, Pokecenter, houses?)

How do we want to go about this?
    - Player movement
        - Smooth movement
            - 1 step = 12 frames = 0.2 sec
            - Stepping
                - Move 2 in new direction
                - Turn, move 14
                - Repeat
